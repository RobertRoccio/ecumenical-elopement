Overview

This is a very simple mod that removes what I consider an illogical obstacle to storytelling and gameplay. Normally, it is almost impossible to elope with characters of a different religion. That makes very little sense since the whole idea of the scheme is for two characters to fall in love (or lust) and enter a marriage against the approval of parents, society, or good judgement. Removing this obstacle opens up interesting storytelling/gameplay possibilities, especially when playing as a small religion, heresy, or crusader state.

What this mod does?
Simple. Different faith will no longer prevent you from initiating an elopement scheme UNLESS the target is zealous. In that case, a penalty will be applied in proportion to the hostility between the two faiths as usual. This has no effect on ordinary marriage, seduction, or courtship. As a result, you still have to overcome the targets's natural dislike of your religion to gain the lover/soulmate status.

Compatibility

This is a very small and low impact mod. As a result, it should work with almost anything. It will require a patch to work correctly with any mod that also modifies the elopement acceptance modifier.
